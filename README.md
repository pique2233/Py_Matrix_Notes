# Py_Matrix_Notes


🎯 A practical notes and exercises repository for mastering **NumPy**, **Pandas...**, and other Python numerical libraries — tailored for **3D Computer Vision** practitioners.

## 📘 About

This repository serves as a hands-on journal of my journey in strengthening Python-based numerical computation, focusing on:

- 🧮 Array operations with **NumPy**
- 📊 Data manipulation with **Pandas**
- 📐 Utility tools for **3D Computer Vision (3DCV)** tasks
- 🧠 Conceptual clarity through annotated code snippets

Whether it's preprocessing point cloud data, reshaping tensors for neural networks, or just wrangling CSVs, these tools are essential for any serious CV engineer.
